    qn: "What is Skillsme Catalog?",
    answer: [
      "Skillsme Catalog is a portfolio topic with several specified requirements for coders to build their portfolios and show their capabilities through it. There are two types of Catalogs on Skillsme: Practice and Rating.",
      "Practice Catalog allows you to practice your coding skills with real portfolios, you can try them unlimited times, but such portfolios won't be counted into your stats and are not visible for employers.",
      "Rating Catalog, on the other hand, is the time-limited topic that Skillsme renews every week. Each Rating Catalog can only try once for each user, and only the portfolio under Rating Catalog can be seen by employers and help you get your job invitation.",
    ],
  },
  {
    qn: "How long would it take for validation?",
    answer: [
      " The time may vary depending on your code quality, as our Judges would give rating only base on their personal interest. But normally a portfolio can get validated within 3 days.",

  },
  {
    qn: "How to make sure the rating is fair?",
    answer: [
      " All users on our platform are anonymous, and no one can invite others to review their works or search for a certain portfolio. Your portfolios' rating will only be judge by the quality of the portfolio. Meanwhile, our pushing algorithm will ensure every portfolio has a fair chance to be visible to other Judges within our community.",
